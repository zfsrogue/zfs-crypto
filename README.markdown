Welcome to the unofficial zfs-crypto branch.

To make it clear, this branch has nothing to do with Sun, Oracle,
ZFSOnLinux, OpenSolaris, IllumOS, OpenIndiana, SmartOS, FreeBSD etc.

There are new files,

zcrypt.c
zcrypt.h
zio_crypt.c
zio_crypt.h
dsl_crypto.c
dsl_crypto.h
libzfs_crypto.c
zcrypt_common.c

which are kept "as is" as much as possible, including (possibly
irrelevant) headers.

The crypto/api/ header files are from OpenSolaris.

The crypto/api implementation is brand new, and supports "bare
minimum" features as needed by ZFS only.

Current support is in BETA. Real ciphers are used, but key generation
function could do with more work. It is NOT compatible with Solaris pools.


Required work:

* Implement more ciphers besides default.

* MACs are in use, but compute_mac() is empty, not called?

* Prompt for key (getpassphrase) needs implementing. It is possible
  that getpass() will suffice on Linux, as it does not limit input to
  8 chars.

* Key needs to be CK_AES prepared, better than current

* All "// FIXME" should be inspected. In particular, known areas
  which differ are PROP_ALIAS, PROP_INHERIT, crypto vs userquota,

* Removed KEY methods "https URI" (requires curl) and pkcs11 types.

* Undo the POOL VERSION=30, put it back to 28, and make CRYPTO be a
  "Named Extension" instead.
